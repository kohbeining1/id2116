    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>I was from Singapore Polytechnic under experience and product design and decided to continue design as it is really interesting and even though it is tiring, I feel the sense of accomplishment and had fun throughout. Being a budding designer, there are so many software to learn which I feel we need to always be on our toes and have the hunger to want to learn, explore and experience new things. My goal is to be able to design for the people, whose needs and wants are required.<div></div>Other than designing, I am also really into sports. I started badminton when I was primary 4 to 6. However, I was unable to get into my desired school which has great badminton team and I liked playing competitive sports, hence I joined basketball in secondary school. It was really rough and my parents did not like it, but I really enjoyed and decided to stay and play for the school. Moving forward to Poly, I started badminton again and played for the school and now in NUS, I joined the Inter varsity polytechnic (IVP) games as well as inter hall games, as I stay in hall due to the travelling time from home to school. I joined badminton, basketball and handball for my hall games. I really like how each sports has the sportsmanship that cannot be found outside or anywhere. Also, the team that you can always rely on and help them when needed. It is really a fulfilling semester and this year, all the matches are coming and I pray we would play and do well, like how we trained. </p>
